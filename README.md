# PacMen Exercise

Description: This project animates the images of Pacmen moving across the page and changes the image in real time to look like the pacmen are chomping. The user has two buttons to select, the first runs the script to add a new image of a pacman and the second runs the animation. 

How to Run: There are no external resources needed to run this script. To use this script, clone the repository to your local machine. 

Roadmap: This script can evolve to include changing of images to face a different direction if it was to go up, down, or left.
